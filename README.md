# Flutter Side Navigation

This package provides support to navigate on your app. 
It was inspired from both the ```BottomNavigationBar``` and ```Drawer```. 
You can think of it as a drawer which is always open. Kind of like a CEO dashboard web application.


## Bugs, Errors etc.
If you find any weird behaviour, bugs or errors please let me know.
Also, an image or a gif will help a lot if the UI behaves differently.
